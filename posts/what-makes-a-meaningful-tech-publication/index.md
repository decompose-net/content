A lot of people produce technology education content these days, particularly content around software development. Too much of that content is repetitive, narrowly focused, and with short expiration dates.

It's too easy to find irrelevant posts covering outdated versions of software, or posts that do not list the date published or the software version used. It's too easy to find posts that take an extremely narrow view of the problem when they should be assessing the trade-offs of multiple possible solutions.
It's far too easy to find posts by multiple people that basically say the same thing.

Technical writing is a surprisingly expansive field. It can be found in a lot of different industries beyond software development. There are many resources available for learning how to produce technical writing, but they are particularly easy to find, and are often presented in formats that feel either overly technical or painfully bland.

Why is it that written work about technology is so hard to use successfully? What does it mean to successfully use a software tutorial? What makes for good documentation?

Who conducts user research and usability testing for their technical content? Companies like Digital Ocean and GitHub are likely doing this, but how often do individual writers think about the usability of the writing on their blogs? How is this evaluated?

We need standards. We need criteria. We need a purpose beyond boosting particular open source projects and trying to become GitHub famous.

Journalists have useful tenets that help guide their work, for example:
- Afflict the comfortable, comfort the afflicted
- Provide information residents need to make informed decisions
- [Equip people to access the information they need to strengthen their communities](https://medium.com/city-bureau/dont-just-engage-equip-7dfc9fe0d3b)

Are technical writers journalists? There's likely a venn diagram that shows the answer is both yes and no depending on context. Either way, technical writing can have different goals than journalism, and establishing useful memes that describe our work at a foundational level would have value for those who are getting started.

What tenets could guide our work to help readers become effective, thoughtful, respectful contributors in their workplace and in the global technology commons?

_Decompose_ will include content beyond just tech tutorials. I plan to include a few types of content: open source software & hardware tutorials, pop culture posts with a loose focus on technology, and perhaps interviews with interesting, relevant people.

While _Decompose_ will have a wide range of content, this publication is where I'll work toward answering: What makes a meaningful technology publication?
